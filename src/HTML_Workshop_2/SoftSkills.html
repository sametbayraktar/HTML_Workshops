        <ol type = "1.">
            <li>
                <b>Communication: </b> SDETs need strong communication skills to effectively collaborate with developers, stakeholders, and other team members, as well as to articulate testing strategies, report bugs, and provide clear documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Problem-solving: </b> SDETs should have excellent problem-solving skills to identify and resolve complex issues in software systems, analyze test failures, and troubleshoot technical challenges that arise during the testing process.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Attention to Detail: </b> SDETs must possess a keen eye for detail to ensure thorough test coverage, identify potential edge cases, and meticulously document and report defects with precise steps to reproduce.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Adaptability: </b> SDETs should be adaptable to changing project requirements, evolving technologies, and dynamic environments. They should be able to quickly learn new tools, frameworks, and methodologies as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Time Management: </b> SDETs need effective time management skills to prioritize tasks, manage multiple testing activities simultaneously, meet deadlines, and ensure efficient utilization of resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Analytical Thinking: </b> SDETs should have strong analytical skills to analyze complex systems, evaluate test results, and interpret data, enabling them to make informed decisions and recommendations for improving software quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Collaboration: </b> SDETs work closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, product managers, and QA engineers. Therefore, they need to have strong collaboration skills to foster effective teamwork, resolve conflicts, and drive collective efforts towards common goals.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Initiative and Proactivity: </b> SDETs should have a proactive mindset, taking the initiative to identify potential improvements in testing processes, propose new strategies or tools, and contribute to the continuous enhancement of the testing practice.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Leadership: </b> SDETs may lead or coordinate testing efforts within a team or project. Therefore, having leadership skills, such as the ability to inspire and motivate others, delegate tasks, and provide guidance, can contribute to the success of the overall testing process.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Continuous Learning: </b> SDETs should have a growth mindset and a thirst for continuous learning. They should stay updated with industry trends, new testing techniques, and emerging technologies to enhance their skills and stay ahead in the field of software testing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Professionalism and Ethical Conduct: </b> SDETs should uphold professional standards and ethical conduct in their work, demonstrating integrity, confidentiality, and respect for intellectual property rights and sensitive data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Test Documentation and Reporting: </b> SDET subjects teach effective documentation and reporting practices to communicate test results, defects, and progress to stakeholders accurately.
            </li>
        </ol>
